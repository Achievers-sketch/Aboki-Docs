A comprehensive API platform for seamless integration of financial services, currency exchange, and transaction management.

## Overview
Thank you for sharing the Aboki API Integrations project documentation. 

The structure is clear, well-organized, and provides a strong foundation for developers looking to integrate with your platform. I appreciate the comprehensive coverage—from authentication and transaction flows to rate retrieval and KYC verification—which makes it easy to understand the full capabilities of the API.
The inclusion of practical integration examples and sandbox access is especially valuable, as it helps streamline onboarding and reduces friction for both client and server-side implementations. Additionally, the changelog demonstrates a commitment to transparency and continuous improvement.
